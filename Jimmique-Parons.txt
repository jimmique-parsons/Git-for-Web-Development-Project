Welcome back Mr. Parsons. Today is the first day of the road to redmption. Please
remember, this road will get challenging and will push you hard. Do not be afraid 
to take breaks and know that it is ok to step away from the computer whenever you
hit a road block while coding. Whatever happens ALWAYS REMEBER YOUR WHY. You are
capable of achieveing anything you put your mind to. Let's go take what already
belongs to you. 11/07/22
